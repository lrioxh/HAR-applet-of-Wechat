##Human Activity Recognition Applet of Wechat

This is a project of applying HAR from scratch, including:

+ **HAR recognition applet**, the result we aimed for, a program collecting accelerometer and gyroscopae data to estimate human activity instantly during a certain time, and calculate how many times each activity has been done afterwards.

+ **HAR.ipynb**, python jupyter notebook to show code and explain process, install jupyter notebook before use

+ **data recording applet**, used for collecting dataset to train and test model
+ **dataset**, small train and test set to exam code, not pretty enough to train the final model

see details in README of the subfolders :D
